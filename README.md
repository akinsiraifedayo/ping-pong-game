## Introduction

Welcome to the classic Pong game implementation using Python and the Turtle graphics library. Pong is a two-player sports simulation game where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. This project recreates the Pong experience, allowing you to challenge a friend or test your skills against the computer.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Play against a friend or the computer.
- Realistic ball and paddle physics: Experience responsive ball and paddle movement.
- Score tracking: Keep track of each player's score on the screen.
- Visual effects: Enjoy smooth animations and a visually appealing game environment.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Python programming concepts
- Python modules: `turtle` (usually included in Python standard library)
